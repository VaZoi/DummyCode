# Admin Dashboard DataLoader

This simple web application provides an admin dashboard to load and display data from various tables in a MySQL database. The dashboard includes buttons for different data categories, such as locations, customers, reservations, rooms, and staff. When a button is clicked, the corresponding data is dynamically loaded and displayed on the page without a full page refresh.

### How to use

Import the dataloader_DummyData.sql file. It is filled with dummy data to test it.
